# StoneShopCash
An iPad App to sell Items from the Stoneshop and store sales in Parse.com. DB is loaded from Parse.com

I'm going to develop an iPad App for a friend of mine who sells stones and minerals.
That App should read the database from Access 2013 via an exported csv-file, which is
imported in Parse.com. The sales are persistantly stered on iPad and later uploaded to Parse.com and 
exported as a csv-file to import the sales in Access 2013 again.
